        <p>President Barack Obama has admitted that his failure to pass &#34;common sense gun safety laws&#34; in the US is the greatest frustration of his presidency. </p><p>In an interview with the BBC, Mr Obama said it was &#34;distressing&#34; not to have made progress on the issue &#34;even in the face of repeated mass killings&#34;.</p><p>He vowed to keep trying, but the BBC&#39;s North America editor Jon Sopel said the president did not sound very confident. </p><p>However, Mr Obama said race relations had improved during his presidency. </p><p>Hours after the interview, a gunman opened fire at a cinema in the US state of Louisiana, killing two people and injuring several others before shooting himself.</p><p>In a wide-ranging interview, President Obama also said:</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33647154">The UK must stay in the EU</a> to have influence on the world stage</li>
<li>He is confident the Iran nuclear deal will be passed by Congress </li>
<li>Syria needs a political solution in order to defeat the Islamic State group</li>
<li>He would speak &#34;bluntly&#34; against corruption <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-33646563">and human rights violations in Kenya</a>
</li>
<li>He would defend his advocacy of gay rights following protests in Kenya</li>
<li>Despite racial tensions, the US is becoming more diverse and more tolerant</li>

If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it&#39;s in the tens of thousands,&#34; Mr Obama said. </p><figure><img src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/555/cpsprodpb/462D/production/_84456971_gettyimages-167501087.jpg" datasrc="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/462D/production/_84456971_gettyimages-167501087.jpg" alt="Gun control campaigners protest in McPhearson Square in Washington DC - 25 April 2013" height="549" width="976"/>
